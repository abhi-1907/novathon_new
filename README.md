PRBLEM STATEMENT:Healthcare providers face challenges in extracting structured data from unstructured medical record images, leading to inefficiencies and delays. 
Manual processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks a centralized, secure platform for accessing critical patient information

PROJECT DESCRIPTION;-This project automates the extraction of text from medical record images using Tesseract OCR and processes it with advanced language models like LLMware and BERT. 

The system classifies and retrieves key details such as patient names, diagnoses, prescriptions, and dates. 

A secure web application presents this structured data, providing authentication for both admin and patient users to ensure efficient and accessible healthcare information management.

TECHNICIAL DETAILS

Frontend: HTML, CSS
OCR Tool: Tesseract OCR
Natural Language Processing: LLMware, BERT
Authentication: Flask-Login
Deployment: Flask server hosting


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

Handwriting Recognition: Improve OCR capabilities to handle handwritten medical records effectively.

Interactive Dashboard: Develop a more dynamic and user-friendly interface with advanced data visualization for admins and patients.

Multi-Language Support: Enable support for extracting and processing records in multiple languages.
